### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a data analyst/enginner with over 15 years experience in data related jobs. 

I've performed many roles including portfolio analysis, relational database design, ETL, dashboard design and build, UAT/Integration testing, root cause analysis, logistic regression, model validation, software development, regulatory reporting, & lead training sessions for Excel/SAS/SQL/Power BI.

In my current work role I'm a software developer/big data enginner coding in Python, Pyspark, & SQL on AWS along with using Jira, Bitbucket, & Airflow. 

My repositories here on GitHub contain some examples of my Python code. Enjoy!

Rick
